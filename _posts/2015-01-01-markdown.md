# MarkDown Help

MarkDown is a technique for quickly writing a plain text document that is then used to generate an HTML document. In fact this document is written in Markdown, with the Markdown document in the left column and the generated HTML output in the right column (if the Format menu is set to HTML). For technically minded folk this editor uses a unique 'dialect' of Markdown which is a modified Gruber with Table support and a few additions to support Extended Wylie and other newer html entities. In each of the sections below are examples of how to produce various types of HTML, what to type is in grey boxes and produced output can be seen below (in the right column).

## Paragraphs

Simply type away but leave a single clear line between paragraphs. Here are some things to try out:

```
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
```

## Changing Text

```
Emphasis, aka italics, is achieved with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, is achieved with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

Mark uses two exclamations. !!this is highlighted!!

Superscript uses a hat. x^2

Subscript uses two v. Base 16 6vv16

Wylie/Tibetan Uchen uses a pair of colons around like this ::rdor je ::.

Paragraphs of Wylie/Tibetan Uchen uses three colons

:::
bla ma / dmar po / rdor je /
bla ma / dmar po / rdor je /
bla ma / dmar po / rdor je /
:::
```

## Headers

As in HTML there are six 'levels' of headings:

```
`# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

There is an alternative style for H1 and H2

Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2
------
```

## Lists

(In this example, leading and trailing spaces are shown with with dots: ⋅)

```
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

## Links to other documents

There are two ways to create links.

```
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself]

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com
```

## Tables

Tables aren't part of the original Markdown specification, but they are supported in this editor.

```
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
```

## Blockquotes

```
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

## Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown (not all tags are supported), and it'll mostly work pretty well.

```
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>
  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *work* **very** well. Use HTML tags also if you like.</dd>
</dl>
```

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>
  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *work* **very** well. Use HTML tags also if you like.</dd>
</dl>
