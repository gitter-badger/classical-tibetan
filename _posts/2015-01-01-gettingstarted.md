# Welcome

**Welcome** to this online editor with support for writing in Tibetan Uchen script. 

Learning to read Tibetan is fairly difficult however learning to **_write_** Tibetan on a computer can be a frustrating experience and complicated as it usually requires a special keyboard configuration and additional time for learning how to type particular characters. 

This editor aims to make it easier for students to get started with writing Tibetan by using a form of writing that uses normal 'roman' letters that you find on a typical keyboard. This is achieved by using the well-known 'Wylie' system of using roman letters to represent Tibetan letters, and this editor takes the Wylie text and transforms it to Uchen script. For example རྡོ་རྗེ or diamond is written by using the roman letter equivalent i.e. rdo rje. This wylie is then typed with a surrounding pair of colon characters to let the editor know to replace it with Uchen i.e. ::rdo rje::.

For the impatient or would just like to get started please jump to the Quick Start guide below.

This editor has two columns the left, input column, and the right, output column, each of which have their own toolbar. If you would like to view only one column please use the resize button to toggle full page and half page size. 

The input column has a settings menu that allows you to configure your preferences:

* theme colours for the input editor
* display line numbers for the input
* wrap option

There is also an upload document for opening a document on your hard disk in this editor, or alternatively, simply copy and paste.

The Mode drop down menu above the input column allows you view help documents or create new documents for your own private use. As this editor only works in your web browser it does not send your documents to a server for saving or storing...please download your document regularly to prevent loss.

You can create full HTML pages by using the Mixed Mode document which supports a technique of writing text that is transformed into HTML called Markdown. This document is written using Markdown and you can see, for instance, that bold text is created by surrounding it with two stars like **this**. A full guide to Markdown can be read if you change the Mode menu to Help: Markdown Guide.

Those who only wish to create Uchen script using a normal keyboard may also use the Mixed Wylie-English mode by using the two colons around any Tibetan portion. The full set of supported Uchen characters are described in the Help: Extended Wylie document available in the Format drop down menu above.

## Quick Start
1. Select from the Mode drop down menu above the left column the New Document you wish to make. Choices are:
  * Wylie - for plain text documents requiring only Tibetan Uchen script plain text output.
  * Mixed Wylie/English - for 'markdown' documents that produce HTML, markdown, and plain text output.
2. Create document:
  * In Wylie mode simply type in the left column to see Tibetan Uchen script output in the right column. To understand Wylie fully please use the drop down menu above the left column to change to the **Extended Wylie** guide for supported letters.
  * In Mixed mode simply type to see output but surrounding Tibetan with a pair of colons (for a few words) or create paragraphs of Tibetan by surrounding with three colons. To understand Wylie fully please use the drop down menu above the left column to change to the **Extended Wylie** guide for supported letters. To understand Markdown fully please use the drop down menu above the left column to change to the **Markdown Guide** for supported formatting.
3. In Format drop down menu above the right column choose the format you wish to see the output.
