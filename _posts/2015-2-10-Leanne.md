# MarkDown Help

This is intended as a quick reference and showcase. For more complete info, see [John Gruber&#39;s original spec](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the [Github-flavored Markdown info page](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

Note that there is also a [Cheatsheet specific to Markdown Here](./Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for. You can also check out [more Markdown tools](./Other-Markdown-Tools).

&lt;a name=&quot;emphasis&quot;/&gt;

## Emphasis

```
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

&lt;a name=&quot;lists&quot;/&gt;

## Lists

(In this example, leading and trailing spaces are shown with with dots: ⋅)

```
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don&#39;t matter, just that it&#39;s a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we&#39;ll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

&lt;a name=&quot;links&quot;/&gt;

## Links

There are two ways to create links.

```
[I&#39;m an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I&#39;m an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com &quot;Google&#39;s Homepage&quot;)

[I&#39;m a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I&#39;m a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself]

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com
```

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn&#39;t. However, many renderers -- like Github&#39;s and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).

```
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks &lt;code&gt;```&lt;/code&gt;, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they&#39;re easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

&lt;pre lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;```javascript
var s = &quot;JavaScript syntax highlighting&quot;;
alert(s);
```

```python
s = &quot;Python syntax highlighting&quot;
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let&#39;s throw in a &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;tag&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;.
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

```javascript
var s = &quot;JavaScript syntax highlighting&quot;;
alert(s);
```

```python
s = &quot;Python syntax highlighting&quot;
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github).
But let&#39;s throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;.
```

&lt;a name=&quot;tables&quot;/&gt;

## Tables

Tables aren&#39;t part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and *Markdown Here* supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

```
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don&#39;t need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
```

&lt;a name=&quot;blockquotes&quot;/&gt;

## Blockquotes

```
&gt; Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
&gt; This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

&gt; This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let&#39;s keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

&lt;a name=&quot;html&quot;/&gt;

## Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it&#39;ll mostly work pretty well.

```
&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Definition list&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Is something people use sometimes.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;Markdown in HTML&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML &lt;em&gt;tags&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
```

&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;hr&quot;/&gt;

## Horizontal Rule

```
Three or more...

---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores
```

## Line Breaks

My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit &amp;lt;Enter&amp;gt; once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You&#39;ll soon learn to get what you want. &quot;Markdown Toggle&quot; is your friend.

Here are some things to try out:

```
Here&#39;s a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it&#39;s a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
```

(Technical note: *Markdown Here* uses GFM line breaks, so there&#39;s no need to use MD&#39;s two-space line breaks.)

&lt;a name=&quot;videos&quot;/&gt;

## Youtube videos

They can&#39;t be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

```
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg&quot;
alt=&quot;IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; border=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
```

Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:

```
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
```

Referencing a bug by #bugID in your git commit links it to the slip. For example #1.
